                            and is the most popular and researched form of meditation in the West.
                            In mindfulness meditation, you pay attention to your thoughts as they pass through your
                            mind. You don’t judge the thoughts or become involved with them. You simply observe and take
                            note of any patterns.
                            This practice combines concentration with awareness. You may find it helpful to focus on an
                            object or your breath while you observe any bodily sensations, thoughts, or feelings.
                            This type of meditation is good for people who don’t have a teacher to guide them, as it can
                            be easily practiced alone.

                            Mantra meditation is prominent in many teachings, including Hindu and Buddhist traditions.
                            This type of meditation uses a repetitive sound to clear the mind. It can be a word, phrase,
                            or sound, one of the most common being “om.”
                            Your mantra can be spoken loudly or quietly. After chanting the mantra for some time, you’ll
                            be more alert and in tune with your environment. This allows you to experience deeper levels
                            of awareness.
                            Some people enjoy mantra meditation because they find it easier to focus on a word than on
                            their breath. Others enjoy feeling the vibration of the sound in their body.
                            This is also a good practice for people who don’t like silence and enjoy repetition.

                            studies in the scientific community.
                            TM was founded by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi and refers to a specific practice designed to quiet
                            the mind and induce a state of calm and peace. It involves the use of mantra and is best
                            taught by a certified TM practitioner.
                            This practice is for those who want an accessible approach to the depth that meditation
                            offers.

                            Oftentimes, this form of meditation involves slowly tightening and relaxing one muscle group
                            at a time throughout the body.
                            In some cases, it may also encourage you to imagine a gentle wave flowing through your body
                            to help release any tension.
                            This form of meditation is often used to relieve stress and unwind before bedtime.

                            It typically involves opening the mind to receive love from others and then sending well

                            This practice involves imagining a scene vividly and using all five senses to add as much
                            detail as possible. It can also involve holding a beloved or honored figure in mind with the
                            intention of embodying their qualities.
                            Another form of visualization meditation involves imagining yourself succeeding at specific
                            goals, which is intended to increase focus and motivation.
                            Many people use visualization meditation to boost their mood, reduce stress levels, and
                            promote inner peace.
