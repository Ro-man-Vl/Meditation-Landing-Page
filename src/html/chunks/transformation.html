                We are what we think, do, eat, breathe and say. So when it comes to starting on a pathway to changing our lifestyle habits, focusing on our body and mind can be quite overwhelming. Do you focus on fitness? Nutrition? Mindset? Changing Habits? Practising Meditation? All of the above? Absolutely! However knowing where to start and how to incorporate sustainable changes in your life can be overwhelming and thus counter intuitive.

                        Share your intentions and goals with your transformation with people that care about you. Ask them to support your intentions, help keep you on track and help you stay motivated.

                        It is easier if we are surrounded by people who know “why we want to achieve what we want to achieve”. For many of us, having the goal and intention of getting healthier is great; however, if we don’t have the support of our partners, friends or children it makes it difficult to free up the time that we need to focus on our fitness, nutrition and self care.

                        We the tend to feel guilty about giving time to these things in our life. We start off prioritising, but slowly let other things creep in – work, household, life and kids and then stress, overwhelm and anxiety takes over.

                        Taking care of your body on the inside and outside is essential. Many of us may prioritise and focus on exercise and eating well, however forget self care or prioritise it much further down the list.

                    <p class="block-content__text">
                        Taking some time out each day to be mindful is great for our minds and our souls. This can be achieved a number of ways.

                    <p class="block-content__text">
                        Gentle stretching is a great way to release the tension through our muscles that is created through exercise, sitting over our laptops and phones all day long. Stretching helps reduce tension in our muscles, increase our blood flow and range of motion in our joints.
