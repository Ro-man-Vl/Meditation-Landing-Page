                            function.
                            Focus all your attention on your breathing. Concentrate on feeling and listening as you
                            inhale and exhale through your nostrils. Breathe deeply and slowly. When your attention
                            wanders, gently return your focus to your breathing.
                            If stress has you anxious, tense and worried, consider trying meditation. Spending even a
                            few minutes in meditation can restore your calm and inner peace.
                            Anyone can practice meditation. It's simple and inexpensive, and it doesn't require any
                            special equipment.
                            And you can practice meditation wherever you are â€” whether you're out for a walk, riding the
                            bus, waiting at the doctor's office or even in the middle of a difficult business meeting.

                        <p id="yoga__simple-bar"> Combining a walk with meditation is an efficient and healthy way to relax. You can use this
                            technique anywhere you're walking, such as in a tranquil forest, on a city sidewalk or at
                            the mall.
                            When you use this method, slow down your walking pace so that you can focus on each movement
                            of your legs or feet. Don't focus on a particular destination. Concentrate on your legs and
                            feet, repeating action words in your mind such as "lifting," "moving" and "placing" as you
                            lift each foot, move your leg forward and place your foot on the ground.
                            Meditation has been practiced for thousands of years. Meditation originally was meant to
                            help deepen understanding of the sacred and mystical forces of life. These days, meditation
                            is commonly used for relaxation and stress reduction.
                            Meditation is considered a type of mind-body complementary medicine. Meditation can produce
                            a deep state of relaxation and a tranquil mind.
                            During meditation, you focus your attention and eliminate the stream of jumbled thoughts
                            that may be crowding your mind and causing stress. This process may result in enhanced
                            physical and emotional well-being.

                        <p class="yoga__simple-bar"> Focusing your attention is generally one of the most important elements of meditation.
                            Focusing your attention is what helps free your mind from the many distractions that cause
                            stress and worry. You can focus your attention on such things as a specific object, an
                            image, a mantra, or even your breathing.
                            Meditation can give you a sense of calm, peace and balance that can benefit both your
                            emotional well-being and your overall health.
                            And these benefits don't end when your meditation session ends. Meditation can help carry
                            you more calmly through your day and may help you manage symptoms of certain medical
                            conditions.
